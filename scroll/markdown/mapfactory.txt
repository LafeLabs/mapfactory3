# Map Factory

## 1. What is a map?  

A map is a combination of geometric and topological information in a human readable form.  

We build maps from multiple media, and link them together both conceptually and physically.

Maps fall into several main categories:

- Laminated paper maps
- World Wide Web maps
- The World, one to one Action Map

The World is the literal space we physically inhabit, on which we place a layer of media which changes how we perceive that world.  

## 2. The Media Feeds of Literal Space

- marker stones: mark nodal points based on street, watershed, factory
- action cards
- signs, beacons, towers
- skeletron trash pods
- server nodes with raspberry pi
- terminal node with geometron keyboard, ArtBox, rubber band, android phone
- books

## 3. The Map Web

- basic format: what it is, position, rotation, scale, link/image
- links
- text
- symbols
- photos and screenshots
- curve

- a note on "security"
- virtual reality
- quantum cyberspace

## 4. Building the Laminated Maps

- methods involving various online tools, google, google maps, wikipedia
- pacing out buildings manually
- creative use of smart phones: gps, useful information etc
- units: some history and methods, a calculator, uncertainties, physics of gps etc.
- what maps we need, how to make them
- how to carry and use the maps, with small markers, gamification

## 5. The Map of Maps

Language, Factory, Watershed, Street, Hyphae, 

## 6. The Watershed
