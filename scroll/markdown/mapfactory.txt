# Map Factory

We must have specificity and productivity.  This is a factory. Signs, markers, maps, action card deck, map of The Street, The Watershed, and The Factory, which starts by just creating itself, but is how all factories are made.  This is not just the map factory it is the factory map.

Perhaps this needs to be absolutely minimal, and a full documentation of the Map Factory software and the various physical media that go with it.  That is all. The product is not so much maps, which are easy and too specific, or full map systems, which belong in Cosmology because that's how deep maps are, but rather mappers: people who can teach other to make maps.  Or Map Teachers.  Or perhaps we are just the Map Factory.  The purpose of the book "Map Factory" is for the reader to *become* the map factory.  




## 1. What is a Map Factory?  

A map is a combination of geometric and topological information in a human readable form.  

A factory is a network of things connected by actions which produce a useful product.

Memes are maps.  Powerpoint slides are maps.  maps are maps.  Circuit diagrams are maps.  


We build maps from multiple media, and link them together both conceptually and physically.

Maps fall into several main categories:

- Laminated paper maps
- World Wide Web maps
- The World, one to one Action Map

The World is the literal space we physically inhabit, on which we place a layer of media which changes how we perceive that world.  

What might a map be?

- a place, literally
- a place, topologically(like a subway map)
- a dictionary, mapping symbols to other symbols via meaning
- maps of buildings
- maps of streets
- maps of waterways
- maps of flows of goods through space, literal, or topological
- maps of perception and of the space of our physical bodies and their direct environments, both literal and figurative

Maps are language.  Maps are also meta language, a system for creating languages.  


Map Factory, as defined here, is a specific way of building maps and factories.  We aim to create a framework which allows the maximum number of people to build the maximum number of possible maps, for maximum freedom.  That is, the maps shown here might not be the map someone wants, but we hope that it points the way to creating the map anyone wants.  We work from a world view that puts us 


## 2. The Media Feeds of Literal Space

physical link factories

- marker stones: mark nodal points based on street, watershed, factory
- action cards
- signs, beacons, towers
- skeletron trash pods
- server nodes with raspberry pi
- terminal node with geometron keyboard, ArtBox, rubber band, android phone
- books
- laminated maps

## 3. The Map Web

digital media factories

- basic format: what it is, position, rotation, scale, link/image
- links
- text
- scroll
- symbols
- photos and screenshots
- curve
- meme construction, generalized memes
- generalization of powerpoint slides, "pitch decks"
- structure of code, use for other applications
- a note on "security"
- virtual reality
- quantum cyberspace
- the terminal
- the web server, free
- building a "real" map: buy domain, get hosting, build map, back up, sanitize the site, link to other maps, local servers.  Google might point you to a site that is "secure" but has links to IP addresses which you can only see on local wifi network, which are pi zero W based web server which is world writeable but hs multiple layers of backup with data pushed to pastebin, github, and other physically local network servers
- the local web server

## 4. Geography


- methods involving various online tools, google, google maps, wikipedia
- pacing out buildings manually
- creative use of smart phones: gps, useful information etc
- units: some history and methods, a calculator, uncertainties, physics of gps etc., the math
- what maps we need, how to make them
- how to carry and use the maps, with small markers, gamification
- surveying in our System, how it relates to "real" surveying




## 5. The Map of Maps

Language, Factory, Watershed, Street, Hyphae, 

## 6. The Watershed

- concept, change of focus
- start small and work up to big
- move from big down to small, note branches and overall structure
- Nodes: confluence
- Symbolism


## 7. The Street

- Philosophy: Hodos and Dao, why Street matters
- Start big, move small, go big again
- Interstates, trucking, flow of goods as non political entity


## 8. The Building/block/corner/camp

- here we are.  Where are we?
- The Strip Mall
- The Truck Stop
- The Marina
- The Enclosed Mall
- The Factory
- The Temple/Church
- The Park
- The Trash Magic Camp
