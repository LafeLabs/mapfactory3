# To Do

- make tables conversion to latex work
- add links in pdf to conversion to latex
- fix image size handling in conversion to latex
- come up with smoother handling of glyph spelling conversion
- add button with exec() command in php to run pdflatex and pdfbook from browser without command line
- add links to all the pdf's from book factory for instant download
- put book factory on a raspberry pi zero node and test
- improve replicator/propagator link
- build trash robot with replicator action cards
- build action card deck for whole system as it exists
- write Path Of Geometron
- develop further the propagator of AG so that it's flexible, where each new person who is looped in builds their own creation which is unique and has its own name--but AG is the name of the system
- create a standard geometron library of shapes and fonts which is in the standard replicator, as well as a standard factory map, a standard meme factory, and standard templates for street and watershed
- put all elements of Geometron into a SINGLE github repository and replicator: map factory, trash robot with GOSP, three,standard scrolls as templates for book, full propagator scrolls for the online system including the 000webhost, rpi zero and a domain from hostinger, with full replication setup in that: rpi has arduino and sd card writer
- add das blinkenlights to the rpi zero standard unit
- finish building out the docking station for the pizerow unit
