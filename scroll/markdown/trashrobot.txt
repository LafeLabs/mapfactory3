# Book of Trash Robot

Self replicating automation

## Five elements:

1. structure: skeletron, thick cardboard,  sticks with added hardware, simple woodworking from broken shipping pallets
2. boards: see the five boards
3. off the shelf parts, arduino, usb,batteries etc, 
4. component electronics: mostly orders from digikey and samtec
5. upcycled/scavenged materials: motors, components, buttons, switches, pcb's, eventually *everything* including transistors and microprocessors


## five boards:

1. Dual H bridge
2. 8 button board
3. GOSP optical pickup board
4. Relaxation oscillator with audio output and knobs
5. Generic UNO Shield with many applications


## The machines


- simple upcycled motor and power supply with knob and buttons control
- same but with stepper motor
- simple manual control xy DC motor bang boom config
- same with steppers
- xyz dc, steppers
- how to program, geometron, GOSP system, how to manage the computer side
- specific xyz for optical stages with small motion in z direction, how to use that for things
- relaxation oscillator for audio feedback of electrochemical interaction, integration into xyz stepper from optical stages
- basic vibration motor, large, for smashing/chipping etc
- various tpyes of vibration motor, of various sizes
- rotational motor with trash coils
- coil winding machine
- rock polishing machine
- rock or ceramic/brick  or wood chipping/carving machine
- heated tool with feedback on xyz control for editing plastic, as well as electrochemistry
- tribo-electric generator for high voltages from rotation
- water pump
- air pump
- vacuum pump
- Trash Magic stick with light, terminal, server, batteries, etc, 
- pressure sensor, temperature sensor, gesture sensor,
