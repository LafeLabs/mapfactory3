# Action Geometry: The Book

This book is the most DIY.  It is a self replicating art book that has some artifacts that are "products" and some which are tools for replication.  The ArtBox can carry the needed tools for replication, or they can be in a generic book bag.  The set we start from for replication is a already-made blank book of folded paper with sewn spine, a ruler, a pen, a pencil, colored pencils OR crayons, the basic shape set, a compass, a needle and thread, scissors, box cutter knife, general pocket knife, packing tape, and a thumb tack.  Optional duct tape, tweezers, pliers, drill and bit, saw, scotch tape, parachute cord, lighter, geometron terminal, geometron server, elmers glue, sidewalk chalk.

## 1. The Shapes:

- equilateral triangle 
- square
- golden triangle
- golden gnomon
- right ososceles triangle
- 30-60-90 triangle
- 5 pointed star and pentagon
- 6 pointed star and hexagon

These all start with a replicator that has the shapes to trace into the initial physical book.  Trace, color.  

product: book of shapes

## 2. Classical Constructions

history, tools, methods, uses

equilateral triangles, hexagons, 6 pointed stars, bisecting a segment, bisecting angle to get 30-60-90 triangles

perpendicular lines, square

golden ratio from square, golden triangle and gnomon from that, expanding and contracting from that

Methods of making "sacred geometry" graphics with pen, points in varying density, how to make it pretty

product: book of Golden Section, etc, Sacred Geometry style, on top of shapes in book

## 3. Platonic Solids

basic facts, nets, stats, symbolism, history, 

cutouts for printing from computer at arbitrary size, choosing the one you need, cutting out and laminating, using for tracing for fab

how to make the models

how to make a wall mount with glue and thick cardboard, fully completed wall hangable art based on platonic solids

Product: pages in book hand drawn with nets, simplified drawings of each solid, which one is which element, symbols of elements, all the stats of each one, how the tetrahedron/octahedron lattice works

coordinates, role of golden rectangles in building it all up



## 4. Artifacts:

- models of the solids
- HDPE dish
- ArtBox
- Skeletron
- String spirals, symbols for node markings
- Plastic Shape Set
- Sewn cloth bags
- sewn blank notebooks

## 5. Replication

How to print this book, bind it, distribute it, how to get it printed in bulk and "sell" with zero added labor.  Cultural directives to spread the Geometry. 



### HDPE dish

HDPE: the best thermoplastic for trash magic.  How to harvest and use it, tools to use, plans for the coin dish made from pentagons

This is a scroll, an instructable, and a video. It is an action card and a gift.  It is *referenced* in the book, but with very minimal details for brevity.  It is just a point in a bullet point list.

## ArtBox

tools, feedstock, plans, extensions, how to use rubber bands, applications, how to use in every day life, how to use for this system.

##  Skeletron

Tools, feedstock

methods

Exact plans for assembling and perfecting the tetrahedron-octahedron skeletron carrier with each edge as 1 anatomic cubit

the skeletron pod of 3 cubit sticks, using a tree, etc in icosahedron configuration

methods of no-drill skelectron for triangular "tent" shape structures

discussion of scaling

## String and stick large scale geometry

Tools, basic methods, general applications

How to construct a parabola, ellipse

chalk, mud, dirt, sand, what it's all for

Specific plans for Golden Spiral as a general marker, maximal scale

surveying with a straw and cardboard theotolite 

product: action card, large spiral

##   Plastic Shapes

Feedstock, tools, methods, applications.  1-3 mm thick ABS plastic, cut with box cutters, scored on minor lines, painted with paint pens, ground smooth, given away en masse

product: the shapes, to be put in a bag in next section

## Sewing; Binding

First, tools, and fabrication of bag for carrying shapes and distributing them to people

Then, how to make THIS BOOK, what that can be used for, the power of the self replicating blank book.  Minimal BOOK OF SHAPES. Methods for minimalist "Sacred Geometry"

products: several blank books, bags for shapes and markers
