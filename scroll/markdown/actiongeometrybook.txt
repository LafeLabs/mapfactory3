# Action Geometry: The Book


## 1. The Shapes:

- equilateral triangle 
- square
- golden triangle
- golden gnomon
- right ososceles triangle
- 30-60-90 triangle
- 5 pointed star and pentagon
- 6 pointed star and hexagon

These all start with a replicator that has the shapes to trace into the initial physical book.  Trace, color.  

## 2. Classical Constructions

history, tools, methods, uses

equilateral triangles, hexagons, 6 pointed stars, bisecting a segment, bisecting angle to get 30-60-90 triangles

perpendicular lines, square

golden ratio from square, golden triangle and gnomon from that, expanding and contracting from that

Methods of making "sacred geometry" graphics with pen, points in varying density, how to make it pretty

## 3. Platonic Solids

basic facts, nets, stats, symbolism, history

cutouts for printing from computer at arbitrary size, choosing the one you need, cutting out and laminating, using for tracing for fab

how to make the models

how to make a wall mount with glue and thick cardboard, fully completed wall hangable art based on platonic solids

## 4. HDPE Dish Fabrication

HDPE: the best thermoplastic for trash magic.  How to harvest and use it, tools to use, plans for the coin dish made from pentagons


## 5. ArtBox

tools, feedstock, plans, extensions, how to use rubber bands, applications, how to use in every day life, how to use for this system.

## 6. Skeletron

Tools, feedstock

methods

Exact plans for assembling and perfecting the tetrahedron-octahedron skeletron carrier with each edge as 1 anatomic cubit

the skeletron pod of 3 cubit sticks, using a tree, etc in icosahedron configuration

methods of no-drill skelectron for triangular "tent" shape structures

discussion of scaling

## 7. String and stick large scale geometry

Tools, basic methods, general applications

How to construct a parabola, ellipse

chalk, mud, dirt, sand, what it's all for

Specific plans for Golden Spiral as a general marker, maximal scale

surveying with a straw and cardboard theotolite 

## 8. Aluminum for optics

Harvesting feedstock, dealing with hazards

tools, methods, how to make safe with HDPE, 90 degree based system, 60 degree system for light

USB bike light

giant parabolic reflector to set things on fire

Other uses of aluminum; future work

## 9.  Plastic Shapes

Feedstock, tools, methods, applications.  1-3 mm thick ABS plastic, cut with box cutters, scored on minor lines, painted with paint pens, ground smooth, given away en masse

## 10. Sewing; Binding

First, tools, and fabrication of bag for carrying shapes and distributing them to people

Then, how to make THIS BOOK, what that can be used for, the power of the self replicating blank book.  Minimal BOOK OF SHAPES. Methods for minimalist "Sacred Geometry"

## 11. Terminal: Relationship to Map Factory

Web page replication, terminal construction, how to use, how to expand, how to replicate it all, connection to MAP FACTORY, which has the action cards, markers, maps, scrolls.  

## 12. Replication

How to print this book, bind it, distribute it, how to get it printed in bulk and "sell" with zero added labor.  Cultural directives to spread the Geometry.
