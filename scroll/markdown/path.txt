### Outline

(this order is very likely wrong)

- Laws of Geometron
- Methods, do's and don'ts how this is and is not a business, this section is the equivalent of a business plan
- Post capitalist industry: capitalism defined as numbers-based value exchange, post-capitalist defined as "looping in" or "metabolizing" _flows_ of information, energy, and materials
- The scales of propagation on the decentralized Web: how to go from 1 to 10 billion, 
- how many web servers, the non parseability of private property in a world of 10,000 universes per human mind without authoritarian computer systems backed by violence
- History and context of "the path": hodos of the West and dao of the east
- The role of alchemy in our philosophical framework
- Trash Magick as a theory and practice 
- How to live without money: metabolizing land, food, coffee, and medical facilities, roles of religious institutions.  This is the actual Path, how we can live and survive past this nightmare of capitalism NOW, just by metabolizing the right people

### Laws of Geometron

The laws of Geometron are not laws like the laws of physics or like the laws of a nation or religion.  They are a mixture of these, and are not ever meant to be taken literally--nothing in our system is.  These are a set of statements which are helpful to guide our thinking in this system, to ensure that we tend to drift in the direction toward better solutions to problems.  

**Everything is recursive**

By this we mean that everything tends to reference itself.  This is a property that self-replicating things tend to have, and we intend for all things created here to be self-replicating.  This means that things contain descriptions of themselves, which can be used to make copies, which will also have those same descriptions.

**Everything is fractal**

Patterns repeat as we zoom in or out in scale.  This is, again, not literal--patterns do not repeat forever or exactly, but as a rule of thumb, we expect to be able to rapidly zoom in or out on a sub-system and see similarities in structure.  In particular, this applies to the self-referencing nature in the first Law: each component is individually self-referencing, and as we zoom out, systems become self-referencing at a system level with simple links to the sub-system information.

**Everything is physical**

It is widely understood at this time that "information is physical".  But if that's true, what is not physical?  Nothing.  Bits in a computer are physical, signals in a wire are, bumps on the surface of a CD, all these things are physical.  And if we're going to build technology that is more sustainable and understandable things will be much more *transparently* physical.

**No money**

This is a post-capitalist system.  We define "capitalism" here to be the use of numbers to denote value, which is really the core of what money is.  In Geometron, things and actions are represented by symbols, which are strung together into glyphs, and information, energy and materials flow through a complex network--all of this is based on actual physical things, which cannot be broken down into numbers.  For survival in the nightmare world of modern capitalism, we will end up taking in money in the short term, but it must always be on a voluntary basis for how much our technology helps exiting business to increase their existing revenue, rather than as payment for our technology per se.  People can pay for our *time* and our *labor* to help them learn and build, but once they know we have not further control over that, which is what "money" in a new technology generally implies.

**No mining**

A lot of things have been mined in the last 2000 years! Way more than we need to build a real civilization that actually works(ulike our current doomed system).  If anything, too much has been mined, we could do with way less uranium and lead for instance. But in terms of the staples like aluminum, copper and iron, we not only have more than enough, we have fully processed and machined material which will form the basis of a much more efficient industrial system.  For 100 years we can be metabolizing the existing capitalist flows of these materials(as they'll keep mining for a long time no matter what), then as our technology matures, we will build more and more loops until all the atoms and structure of our technological civilization is in loops and no one mines ever again.  

**No property**

All property is based on violence.  We do not seek to attack the existing systems of property/violence with this system directly, however.  Our task is to build technology without property that is so superior to anything existing in the property system that there simply is no value to their technology anymore--without violent coercion their lawns and cars are worth nothing, and that coercion goes away as soon as our system is self-sustaining.

**Look at the fungi**

Fungi define their bodies and selves differently than we do in the animal or even plant kingdoms.  Fungi are deeply integrated into their environments.  There are many fungal parables we can tell, but the core of this belief is that we take inspiration from how fungi digest food.  Rather than ingest food and do chemistry with it to make it digestible, fungi release their digestive enzymes into the environment and cause molecular improvement outside their bodies which build up that environment benefiting all. We seek to do the same: releasing bits of information into the environment around us which cause improvements to happen from which we will benefit from in some global sense but without regard to specifics of who did what.

**Look at the insects**

Insects are vastly more successful at high density urban society than we are. They have systems of building cities with agriculture, social systems, complex labor tasks and vast architecture which rival our best cities in relative scale but which *as systems* have lasted for many millions of years in relative equilibrium with the rest of the world.  This is in contrast to our cities which are constantly right on the verge of collapse and which have always been driven by unsustainable growth, conquest, enslavement, and resource destruction.  And yet for all this technology the insects lack almost all of the qualities we claim make us special: higher thinking, complex language of the kind we use, money and economics, and above all our obsession with eternal life of our individual egos.  To look at the insects, as with the fungi, is to walk on the path of losing our egos, realizing we are part of a larger whole not just in space but in time.  We will all die, and what really matters is not what we do, but how we flow with what is happening in that whole. 

**Language is how the mind parses reality**

Litteralism is evil. We pretend that our language is just a thin veil we peer through at the Universe but a major principle of Geometron is that this is false.  Language is not a thin veil, it is an all-encompassing screen which defines not just how we communicate but how we think and how we perceive reality itself.  


### Methods of Geometron

- we are not a company
- no owned property, domains are "owned" by participants separately
- no patents, no trademarks, no copyrights, no equity not debt
- no employees, no corporate structure including non profit
- everything is done by people who are also whatever else they are if they are in a System of some kind--people have jobs, homes etc, that is what it is, but this is all free and on top of that and in on and around that
- we don't buy and sell things as an entity, just as individuals and camps, or as existing organizations like schools, churches, businesses, etc. Geometron does not exist


## Living without money


We create value.  Networking creates value.  Redirecting materials which were going to the trash into productive products creates value.  Building robots that can produce manufactured products creates value.  Teaching people useful know how creates value.  

Under the money system, creators of value require money from those who already have it in order to reap the benefit of that value.  All money comes from miners or bankers originally under the money system.  Thus, given a fixed amount of created new money, those who create value from nothing have two choices.  We can be under compensated, or we can suck out all the value eventually from those who do not create value from nothing.  In practice we see both of these in modern society: people who create vast productive output but do not benefit from it at all(people who do unpaid labor), and people who turn into super-landlords sucking out all value from society based on their network-value creation(e.g. tech companies).


As geometron practitioners we create vast value from nothing, amplifying existing value using network effects more and more until we can build up a whole economy from scratch. And yet with money as the driving force in society this cannot grow without sucking money out of the rest of the system, it cannot get the true value of its increase value.  All this is due fundamentally to what money is: a number. Even under the very aggressive pro-inflation policy of central banks, we can never create numerical value fast enough to make pace with how fast actual value can scale in a networked system(exponentially with a very steep exponent).  This is why the center of power for our economy has shifted how it has over time: railroads, banking, media, software etc.  The power tracks where value can be exponentially built up from nothing.  A capitalist would just call this "capitalism".  Perhaps.  But what is capitalism? 

Capitalism could be thought of as a model of the universe, a religion or belief system, an "economic" system, or a philosophy.  I think of it primarily as a theory of the world: that value is represented by numbers.  What we propose as an alternative is a system based not on static numerical value but on the flows of value. 

For example in capitalism, a classical "product" such as a blueberry muffin is "sold" for a "price".  The materials are bought at a price, etc. going back to various farmers, by way of truckers, bakers, etc.  

In Geometron, we don't focus on static value.  Rather, we focus on how things such as energy, information and materials *flow* through our systems.  Thus, rather than truncate the whole universe of that blueberry muffin into a price of $3.99, we primarily view the muffin as a flow from farmer through trucker and baker through eater of muffin to whatever that person does and how they dispose of their personal solid waste, which also has value.  We live in a vast universe then consisting of all these intersecting flows of value.

How does one parse this and why is it more useful than money?  We parse it by organizing this whole world into a Universe we build up using the various language tools of geometron.  This language set is a combination of online tools and physical artifacts we build and exchange, much like physical currency under capitalism.  The skeptic will again ask what this adds, why bother to add all this complexity.  There are several answers. 

One answer is we are enabling the creation of value which can grow exponentially with a much steeper exponent than would otherwise be possible.  Also, rather than money or some kind of barter token specific to the value of a thing, our physical data which replaces currency carries the information required to actually take actions to continue the path of value.  For instance an action card which has the detailed instructions to build 100 units of a robot can pass around to 100 people in a week, and 10,000 robots will get built.  Suppose those robots are "worth" the equivalent of 100 dollars each in money.  That is 1 million dollars built up in value in a week from nothing.  That kind of steep value creation(starting from zero) cannot be supported by the tools of capitalism because the "cost of capital" will always limit how fast you can buy the inventory to ramp up.  

We will build up a new economy from nothing, which can grow and create value vastly faster than is possible in the monetary system.  In this system the existing resources we have access to are based on what we "loop in" or "metabolize".  So depending on  need we must metabolize certain things as quickly as possible: shelter, food, and medicine.  Thus building Geometron nodes near medical facilities is a imperative, so that doctors, nurses and pharmacists may be looped in.  Building the equivalent of millions of dollars of value into a hospital should be enough to loop in the people in the invading Geometron camp, leading to health care for all. As people are metabolized in the organization, they'll spread to other similar organizations, build new camps, and spread value back down into the other camps we build separately.  Shopping centers are one of the default patterns we'll tend to metabolize.  Networked flow of value in a shopping center can create the same kinds of exponential growth leveraged by large companies today, but locally focused.  Religious institutions are also a mainstay of our network.  We should be able to find land we can camp on and a ready and willing set of believers who can incorporate our language tools into their existing faith, and hence into their charitable works, directing metabolization out into the populace to whom they minister.


## Cosmology


The central cosmology is simply the language built up from the Nine Laws.  The structure that is arranged symbolically around that structure are the three corners of the Triangle: the Factory, the Watershed and the Street.

### The Watershed

We are all always in a watershed.  Water is pushed by the sun from the Sea to the Sky.  From there it flows down via rain through all the various habitats we live in. The watershed is part of our Universe, more fundamental than anything else: particle physics and astronomy don't matter compared to the flow of water.  This is literally life.  We must start to think of our lives as a path long waterways.  There is an ocean we live near, a biggest-river, a tributary, streams, ponds, aquafers etc..  Then in addition to this there is the artificial flow which defines how we move water through our society: reservoirs, water treatment facilities, sewage plants, storms sewers, aquaducts, etc.  Our network of information recognizes nodes in the watershed network as having meaning, and we organize communities in the network accordingly.


### The Street

Hodos.  Dao.  The Path.  Many words, one over arching idea: that as humans we walk along paths which define us.  Those paths can be just ideas, and sets of actions. Or they can be very literal paved streets, driven on by trucks and cars, or walked along the side of.

The Street is the heierarchy of our world based entirely on the physical streets, ignoring politics.  Thus the top level of that world might be something like "the Interstate 95 corridor".  The lowest level might be the sidewalk on a particular corner where we have set up a temporary camp with a Geometron node.

### The Factory

The Factory in Geometron is a structure which consists of a sequence of actions and the infrastrcutre to support those actions which create a useful product of some kind.  The factories of the basis set of geometron include:

- book factory
- trash robot factory
- action geometry factory
- cardboard factory
- symbol factory(and markers)
- map factory(html and paper)
- curve factory
- scroll factory
- skeletron factory
- pi server factory
- pi server factory factory
- action deck factory
- artbox


These are factories that are a part of Geometron.  However, when we use the Goemetron world view we must observe and document the *existing* factories.  These are patterns of value flow, which we map out to track how value *flows* through the system. This might be for example a local shop which sells items that are brought in by truck.  The "shop" is a particle-like "business" which instantly transforms inventory into money.  The factory, on the other hand, is the full value flow network which includes the extraction of raw materials for the products, the labor to transform it, the shipping infrastructure to deliver it, the labor to sell and store it, the value of having it on the shelf and available, the value of the use by the purchaser, and the inevitable post-use trajectory of the materials.  This complex network of information includes pieces of information not encoded in simple "price"-based values.  Largest missing pieces which should change our whole cosmology are the "endpoints" of the paths: the extraction and disposal. In capitalism, everything is on a constant flow from the mine to the landfill.  By extending our attention along these paths we can connect up the ends, removing both mine and landfill ultimately.  

This closing of loops is one way that the Geometron network will create value from nothing with exponential scaling: by creating a platform for effective upcycling at scale.  Every shopping center generates a stream of boxes and shipping pallets.  We must immediately loop those in and be creating a stream of useful products from this.  But such a stream will be hard to "sell" in existing systems.  Thus to keep the flow moving we need to go find ways to loop these products in where they are needed.  This might be way outside the vague grey middle that a typical shopping center is currently targeted.  Rather, we will in some cases loop in a segment from the upper echelons of capitalist heierarchy, making very high end specialized products.  In other cases we will loop in those most in need of shelter and related structural technologies.  In the case of the landed gentry and those currently with no permanent home, this might be one loop: from the shopping center to the people looking for land to the people with excess land, building added value in all phases of this system, with the combined genius of the under appreciated humanity currently being oppressed by the capitalist Enemy.  Ultimately the value must loop back to the shopping center which is feeding the raw materials in from the trucks on the Street.  And we must go farther back through the truckers to the factory sources, etc. and eventually loop it all together.  

Why now?  If all that is needed to replace capitalism with a just system, why has it not happened yet? Because of networked communication technology.  At every stage in human history, our ability to use technology to communicate is what defines what we can do and what we choose to do.  The most fundamental aspects of networked communication have gone through a totally unprecedented revolution in the last 10-20 years.  This sets the stage for totally new ways to approach all human activity, including engaging in value propagation, what people now call "economics".  It also affects how we approach religion, politics, family life, community social life, manufacturing, and the very nature of what it is to be alive.  By dealing with how language is processed on existing hardware and software, Geometron seeks to put the most generic possible tools in peoples hands for free, which can be used to build up any custom set of tools for a new way of living up by the people.  

## Geometron Basis set


The basis set replicates itself.  The set has all information needed to make every element of itself.  "Replication" can mean several things here.  It might mean buying an off the shelf component of which there are an effectively infinite number(number purchased can scale up with existing corporate infrastructure, not in some "geometron incorporated", which will never exist.  In many cases it will mean making needed connections for things to be done in a place.  For instance, we might start working on soldering circuit boards for Trash Robot in the maker space of a local public library, then teach more and more people to solder and ramp up production capacity.  Again as with buying off the shelf parts, we must scale horizontally.  It never makes sense to simply ramp up the soldering in one space, rather we scale by finding new spaces to solder in.
