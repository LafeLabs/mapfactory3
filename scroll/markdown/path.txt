# The Path of Geometron

### Outline

(this order is very likely wrong)

- Laws of Geometron
- Methods, do's and don'ts how this is and is not a business, this section is the equivalent of a business plan
- Post capitalist industry: capitalism defined as numbers-based value exchange, post-capitalist defined as "looping in" or "metabolizing" _flows_ of information, energy, and materials
- The scales of propagation on the decentralized Web: how to go from 1 to 10 billion, 
- how many web servers, the non parseability of private property in a world of 10,000 universes per human mind without authoritarian computer systems backed by violence
- History and context of "the path": hodos of the West and dao of the east
- The role of alchemy in our philosophical framework
- Trash Magick as a theory and practice 
- How to live without money: metabolizing land, food, coffee, and medical facilities, roles of religious institutions.  This is the actual Path, how we can live and survive past this nightmare of capitalism NOW, just by metabolizing the right people

### Laws of Geometron

The laws of Geometron are not laws like the laws of physics or like the laws of a nation or religion.  They are a mixture of these, and are not ever meant to be taken literally--nothing in our system is.  These are a set of statements which are helpful to guide our thinking in this system, to ensure that we tend to drift in the direction toward better solutions to problems.  

**Everything is recursive**

By this we mean that everything tends to reference itself.  This is a property that self-replicating things tend to have, and we intend for all things created here to be self-replicating.  This means that things contain descriptions of themselves, which can be used to make copies, which will also have those same descriptions.

**Everything is fractal**

Patterns repeat as we zoom in or out in scale.  This is, again, not literal--patterns do not repeat forever or exactly, but as a rule of thumb, we expect to be able to rapidly zoom in or out on a sub-system and see similarities in structure.  In particular, this applies to the self-referencing nature in the first Law: each component is individually self-referencing, and as we zoom out, systems become self-referencing at a system level with simple links to the sub-system information.

**Everything is physical**

It is widely understood at this time that "information is physical".  But if that's true, what is not physical?  Nothing.  Bits in a computer are physical, signals in a wire are, bumps on the surface of a CD, all these things are physical.  And if we're going to build technology that is more sustainable and understandable things will be much more *transparently* physical.

**No money**

This is a post-capitalist system.  We define "capitalism" here to be the use of numbers to denote value, which is really the core of what money is.  In Geometron, things and actions are represented by symbols, which are strung together into glyphs, and information, energy and materials flow through a complex network--all of this is based on actual physical things, which cannot be broken down into numbers.  For survival in the nightmare world of modern capitalism, we will end up taking in money in the short term, but it must always be on a voluntary basis for how much our technology helps exiting business to increase their existing revenue, rather than as payment for our technology per se.  People can pay for our *time* and our *labor* to help them learn and build, but once they know we have not further control over that, which is what "money" in a new technology generally implies.

**No mining**

A lot of things have been mined in the last 2000 years! Way more than we need to build a real civilization that actually works(ulike our current doomed system).  If anything, too much has been mined, we could do with way less uranium and lead for instance. But in terms of the staples like aluminum, copper and iron, we not only have more than enough, we have fully processed and machined material which will form the basis of a much more efficient industrial system.  For 100 years we can be metabolizing the existing capitalist flows of these materials(as they'll keep mining for a long time no matter what), then as our technology matures, we will build more and more loops until all the atoms and structure of our technological civilization is in loops and no one mines ever again.  

**No property**

All property is based on violence.  We do not seek to attack the existing systems of property/violence with this system directly, however.  Our task is to build technology without property that is so superior to anything existing in the property system that there simply is no value to their technology anymore--without violent coercion their lawns and cars are worth nothing, and that coercion goes away as soon as our system is self-sustaining.

**Look at the fungi**

Fungi define their bodies and selves differently than we do in the animal or even plant kingdoms.  Fungi are deeply integrated into their environments.  There are many fungal parables we can tell, but the core of this belief is that we take inspiration from how fungi digest food.  Rather than ingest food and do chemistry with it to make it digestible, fungi release their digestive enzymes into the environment and cause molecular improvement outside their bodies which build up that environment benefiting all. We seek to do the same: releasing bits of information into the environment around us which cause improvements to happen from which we will benefit from in some global sense but without regard to specifics of who did what.

**Look at the insects**

Insects are vastly more successful at high density urban society than we are. They have systems of building cities with agriculture, social systems, complex labor tasks and vast architecture which rival our best cities in relative scale but which *as systems* have lasted for many millions of years in relative equilibrium with the rest of the world.  This is in contrast to our cities which are constantly right on the verge of collapse and which have always been driven by unsustainable growth, conquest, enslavement, and resource destruction.  And yet for all this technology the insects lack almost all of the qualities we claim make us special: higher thinking, complex language of the kind we use, money and economics, and above all our obsession with eternal life of our individual egos.  To look at the insects, as with the fungi, is to walk on the path of losing our egos, realizing we are part of a larger whole not just in space but in time.  We will all die, and what really matters is not what we do, but how we flow with what is happening in that whole. 

**Language is how the mind parses reality**

Litteralism is evil. We pretend that our language is just a thin veil we peer through at the Universe but a major principle of Geometron is that this is false.  Language is not a thin veil, it is an all-encompassing screen which defines not just how we communicate but how we think and how we perceive reality itself.
