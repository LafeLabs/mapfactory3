# The Path of Geometron

### Outline

- Laws of Geometron
- Methods, do's and don'ts how this is and is not a business, this section is the equivalent of a business plan
- Post capitalist industry: capitalism defined as numbers-based value exchange, post-capitalist defined as "looping in" or "metabolizing" _flows_ of information, energy, and materials
- The scales of propagation on the decentralized Web: how to go from 1 to 10 billion, 
- how many web servers, the non parseability of private property in a world of 10,000 universes per human mind without authoritarian computer systems backed by violence
- History and context of "the path": hodos of the West and dao of the east
- The role of alchemy in our philosophical framework
- Trash Magick as a theory and practice 
- How to live without money: metabolizing land, food, coffee, and medical facilities, roles of religious institutions.  This is the actual Path, how we can live and survive past this nightmare of capitalism NOW, just by metabolizing the right people

### Laws of Geometron

The laws of Geometron are not laws like the laws of physics or like the laws of a nation or religion.  They are a mixture of these, and are not ever meant to be taken literally--nothing in our system is.  These are a set of statements which are helpful to guide our thinking in this system, to ensure that we tend to drift in the direction toward better solutions to problems.  

**Everything is recursive**

By this we mean that everything tends to reference itself.  This is a property that self-replicating things tend to have, and we intend for all things created here to be self-replicating.  This means that things contain descriptions of themselves, which can be used to make copies, which will also have those same descriptions.

**Everything is fractal**

Patterns repeat as we zoom in or out in scale.  This is, again, not literal--patterns do not repeat forever or exactly, but as a rule of thumb, we expect to be able to rapidly zoom in or out on a sub-system and see similarities in structure.  In particular, this applies to the self-referencing nature in the first Law: each component is individually self-referencing, and as we zoom out, systems become self-referencing at a system level with simple links to the sub-system information.

**Everything is physical**

It is widely understood at this time that "information is physical".  But if that's true, what is not physical?  Nothing.  Bits in a computer are physical, signals in a wire are, bumps on the surface of a CD, all these things are physical.  And if we're going to build technology that is more sustainable and understandable things will be much more *transparently* physical.

**No money**

This is a post-capitalist system.  We define "capitalism" here to be the use of numbers to denote value, which is really the core of what money is.  In Geometron, things and actions are represented by symbols, which are strung together into glyphs, and information, energy and materials flow through a complex network--all of this is based on actual physical things, which cannot be broken down into numbers.  For survival in the nightmare world of modern capitalism, we will end up taking in money in the short term, but it must always be on a voluntary basis for how much our technology helps exiting business to increase their existing revenue, rather than as payment for our technology per se.  People can pay for our *time* and our *labor* to help them learn and build, but once they know we have not further control over that, which is what "money" in a new technology generally implies.

**No mining**



**No property**

**Look at the fungi**

**Look at the insects**

**Language is how the mind parses reality**
