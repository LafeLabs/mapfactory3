### Some notes on how this all links together

Cosmology is nothing without action.  Any real industry will need both the core robotics basis for automation etc, and a way to share the information with people.  So we need the map/factory and the trash robots.  But without Geometron, the digital map factory system loses its power, so we need that language.  And that language makes no sense without AG.  Also AG is the most basic and simple and non technical self replicating physical and also cultural element here, so it comes first.  

The whole thing is a factory which creates a mode of being.  If this technology works, it will combine numerous paths of information transmission to transform people's lives so that they can build into and benefit from this ecosystem of things.   We will all be able to use this system to do anything we were doing better.  

Business which work with this system will have huge advantages over those who don't by using a free and scalable network effect.  All those billions of dollars stolen by the gangsters of Facebook and Google represent lost value which, with a truly free network that has lower impedance than those networks, can by not only reclaimed but made back many times over.  

Those with no resources at all can use the system to build shelters and factories so that we can live in some comfort until we have more space to function, and generate value which can get money from the existing industrial system by building robot factories.  These factories can add vast value, by making tools to make automation, on the fly, from found materials, and which can solve a very wide range of problems for almost no added costs.  Multi million dollar automation solutions can be created for hundreds of dollars with these systems(using Geometron to create glyphs which control machines).  Robot factories with fundamentally new types of functionality than anything the Capitalist Enemy has now create such high value and require so little input that this can be the financial basis by which those of us who choose to quit the system or who are already shut out of the system today can not only survive but thrive and grow. 

Note that these notes all will go into the 5th chapter, as we define cosmology as a description of being and of potential being, so this is cosmology of the cosmos we are creating, which is defined by the paths we choose to take in life.
