Emergence of the "tech people" as an evil, mindless AI.  History which traces back to bureaucracy from before computers, mostly via military empires and the Church, tracing back to various temple-based power structures of Axial Age and before.  This system is the enemy of all living minds which are not the System.  

Capitalism, and the failure of number based currency to ever solve the problems it creates: slavery reparations, landlordism, destruction of the natural world.  Hence, a shift from number to network construction.  But in order to navigate a topological network we need ICONS, and MAPS, both of which require GEOMETRY.  Hence GEOMETRON.
